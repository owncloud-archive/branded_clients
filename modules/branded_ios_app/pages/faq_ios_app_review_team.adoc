*Questions:*

* What is the purpose of declaring Audio background mode? Please explain the need for this background mode and where the usage can be found in your binary.
* Your app declares support for audio in the UIBackgroundModes key in your Info.plist but did not include features that require persistent audio. The audio key is intended for use by applications that provide audible content to the user while in the background, such as music player or streaming audio applications. Please revise your app to provide audible content to the user while the app is in the background or remove the ``audio'' setting from the UIBackgroundModes key.

Howerver, the ownCloud app used it only when music is played. This may be checked by Apple reviewers, what we suggest is to be proactive, instead of waiting for the app to be rejected because of that, adding an explanation line, something such as: You may notice that the app is ready to play music not only in foreground but also in background, for you to test it we have uploaded to the test account the file XXX
