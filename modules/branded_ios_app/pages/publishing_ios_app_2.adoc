Start by creating a .certSigningRequest (CSR) file on your Mac, using Keychain Access. Open Finder, and then open Keychain Access from the Utilities folder.

Next, open *Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority*.

Enter the email address that you use in your Apple developer account, and enter a common name. The common name can be anything you want, for example a helpful descriptive name like ``ios-mybiz''. Check *Saved to disk* and *Let me specify key pair information*, then click *Continue*.

Give your CSR a helpful descriptive name, such as *iosapp.certSigningRequest*, and choose the location to save it on your hard drive, then click *Save*.

In the next window, set the *Key Size* value to *2048 bits* and *Algorithm* to *RSA*, and click *Continue*. This will create and save your certSigningRequest file (CSR) to your hard drive.

You also get a corresponding public and private key pair, which you can see in the *Login > Keys* section of Keychain.

The next screen, *About Creating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)* has information about creating a CSR in Keychain Access. You already did this, so go to the next screen. ``Add iOS Certificate'', to upload the CSR you already created, then click the *Generate* button.

Your new certificate is named *ios_distribution.cer*. Download it to your Mac; then find it and double-click on it to install it properly in Keychain.

After installing it, you should see it stored with its corresponding private key in Keychain.
