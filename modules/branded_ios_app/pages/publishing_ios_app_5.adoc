= Create Provisioning Profiles

:toc:

The next phase of this glorious journey is to create eight provisioning profiles: 4 Ad Hoc and 4 App Store <app_store_profiles_label>. You will email the four Ad Hoc profiles, and your P12 certificate <publishing_ios_app_6> (which you will create after your provisioning profiles), to support@owncloud.com after building your branded app with the ownBrander app on https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud[Customer.owncloud.com]. *Do not send us the App Store profiles.* All eight of these profiles must be stored on your Mac PC.

== Create Four App Store Profiles

Creating your four App Store profiles is the same as creating your Ad Hoc profiles, except that when you start you check the App Store checkbox, and you won’t select testing devices.

When you’re finished, you’ll have eight new provisioning profiles. Remember, when you build your app on ownBuilder you only send in the four Ad Hoc profiles, plus your P12 certificate.
