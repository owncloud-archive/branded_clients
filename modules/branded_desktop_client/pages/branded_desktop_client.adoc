= Building a Branded Desktop Sync Client


To build a branded Desktop sync client you need to supply your own artwork, and use the ownBrander wizard in your account on https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud[Customer.owncloud.com].
The ownBrander wizard details the required image specifications.

Start with the Common section at the top, and enter information common to all clients that you can build with ownBrander.
You may override any settings in the Common section in the client sections.

Then go to the Desktop client section of ownBrander, which has two sections, Required and Optional.

Work your way through the wizard, entering required elements and any optional elements you wish.
When you have completed the wizard, press the *Generate Desktop Client* button.
You will either get messages warning you of any items that need to be corrected, or a success message:

It takes 24-48 hours to build your client, and then youâ€™ll see it in your account on https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud[Customer.owncloud.com].
