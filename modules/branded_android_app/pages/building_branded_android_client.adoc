= Building Your App With ownBrander

:toc:

See the https://github.com/owncloud/branded_clients/wiki/Branded-ownCloud-Clients-FAQ[FAQ for additional information]

Building an Android app requires just a few images, and the wizard tells you their required dimensions. They must be the exact specified dimensions, preferably in PNG format.

First, start on the Common tab and enter your application name and the URL to your ownCloud server. For testing purposes these can be anything. These are your global defaults, and you can change them when you create your apps. When you create production apps, then you must use your real app name, and the URL must point to your real ownCloud server.

Next, go to the Android tab. This has three sections: *Required*, *Suggested*, and *Advanced*. Start in the *Required* section with your application name and server URL, which should be already entered from the Common tab. You may change these, and optionally check *Server URL visible* to allow users to change it.

Now enter your Android package name. This is the unique name that identifies it to Google Play. Then enter your account type; this identifies it on your users’ Android devices.

Your next three options are *Show multiaccount or disconnect*, *Enable send to other apps features*, and *Enable SAML*. When you enable *Show multiaccount or disconnect*, your users can configure multiple ownCloud accounts. When it is disabled they see only a disconnect button.

*Enable SAML* is for ownCloud servers that use SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) authentication.

*Enable send to other apps features* allows your users to open ownCloud files with other Android apps, such as file managers and photo galleries.

Next, upload your images. The wizard tells you the exact size they must be, and you can click the images on the right to see some example screenshots.

You may enter a custom user agent, if you wish, and display a new account link button to your users. You need this to enable multiaccounts.

== Signing Android Client

The next option is *Sign Android Client*. You can upload your signing certificate in the wizard so that is signed during the build process, or you can optionally sign your app after we build it. See publishing_android_app to learn how to sign your app after it is built.

Google Play Store requires that certificates have a validity period ending after October 22, 2033. See link:[<http://developer.android.com/intl/es/tools/publishing/app-signing. html#considerations>].

*Root folder name* displays the root folder name on your user’s devices.

*Help url* is for entering a link to your help page for the app.

*Activate ``Recommend'' option* displays a ``recommend this app'' option via email.

Use *Activate the option feedback* to display an email address for user feedback.

*Imprint URL* is for the about page on your Web site, or any page that has information about your company.

Enter any custom download link in *URL to download the app*.

Finally, if you are creating a paid app then check the checkbox for *Paid Users* and upload an icon.

The *Suggested* and *Advanced* sections allow you to further customize your branding with custom colors and images.

When you are finished click the *Generate Android App* button, and you will either see a success message, or an error message telling you what you need to fix. Note also that at the bottom of the wizard, the name and version of your new app is displayed, for example *The version that it will be generated is: oc-android-2.0.0_signed*. When all of your options are entered correctly and you click the Generate Android App button, it takes up to 48 hours for your app to appear in your https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud/[Customer.owncloud.com] account.
