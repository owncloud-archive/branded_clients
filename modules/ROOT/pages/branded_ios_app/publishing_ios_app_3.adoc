== Create Bundle IDs

The next step is to create four *Bundle IDs*.
These are unique identifiers for your branded iOS app.
You must also create an *App Group* and place your three *Bundle IDs* in your *App Group*.
You will need your base *Bundle ID* and *App Group* when you build your app with the ownBrander app on https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud[customer.owncloud.com].

== Create App ID

Now you must create your App ID.
Go to *Identifiers > App IDs* and click the btn:[plus button] (top right) to open the "Register iOS App ID" screen.
Fill in your *App ID Description*, which is anything you want, so make it helpful and descriptive.
The *App ID Prefix* is your Apple Developer Team ID, and is automatically entered for you.

Scroll down to the *App ID Suffix* section and create your *Bundle ID*.
Your *Bundle ID* is the unique identifier for your app.
Make a note of it because you will need it as you continue through this process.
The format for your *Bundle ID* is reverse-domain, e.g. _com.MyCompany.MyProductName_.

The next section, *App Services*, is where you select the services you want enabled in your app.
You can edit this anytime after you finish creating your *App ID*.
Check *App Groups*, make your other selections and then click the btn:[Continue] button at the bottom.
Now you can confirm all of your information.
If everything is correct click btn:[Submit]; if you need to make changes use the btn:[Back] button.
