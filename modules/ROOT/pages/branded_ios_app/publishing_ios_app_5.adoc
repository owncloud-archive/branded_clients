== Next Step

The next phase of this glorious journey is to create eight provisioning profiles: 4 Ad Hoc and 4 App Store <app_store_profiles_label>.
You will email the four Ad Hoc profiles, and your P12 certificate <publishing_ios_app_6> (which you will create after your provisioning profiles), to support@owncloud.com after building your branded app with the ownBrander app on https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud[customer.owncloud.com]. *Do not send us the App Store profiles.* All eight of these profiles must be stored on your Mac PC.

== First Ad Hoc Provisioning Profile

Go to *Provisioning Profiles > All*, then click the btn:[plus button] (top right) to open the _Add iOS Provisioning Profile_ screen.
Select btn:[Ad Hoc] and click btn:[Continue].

On the *Select App ID* screen select the first of the three App IDs that you created and click btn:[Continue]. (The first one has the shortest name, if you followed the naming conventions in this manual.)

When it has generated, download your new profile to your Mac computer.

There is a 50-character limit, but don’t worry about counting characters because it will be automatically truncated if you go over.

You should now see all of your Ad Hoc provisioning profiles listed in your "iOS Provisioning Profiles".

== Create Four App Store Profiles

Creating your four App Store profiles is the same as creating your Ad Hoc profiles, except that when you start you check the App Store checkbox, and you won’t select testing devices.

When you’re finished, you’ll have eight new provisioning profiles.
Remember, when you build your app on ownBuilder you only send in the four Ad Hoc profiles, plus your P12 certificate.
