Enter the email address that you use in your Apple developer account, and enter a common name.
The common name can be anything you want, for example a helpful descriptive name like "ios-mybiz".
Check btn:[Saved to disk] and btn:[Let me specify key pair information], then click btn:[Continue].

Give your CSR a helpful descriptive name, such as *iosapp.certSigningRequest*, and choose the location to save it on your hard drive, then click btn:[Save].

The next screen, *About Creating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)* has information about creating a CSR in Keychain Access.
You already did this, so go to the next screen. "Add iOS Certificate", to upload the CSR you already created, then click the btn:[Generate] button.

Your new certificate is named *ios_distribution.cer*.
Download it to your Mac; then find it and double-click on it to install it properly in Keychain.
