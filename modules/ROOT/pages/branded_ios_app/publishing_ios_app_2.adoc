Enter the email address that you use in your Apple developer account, and enter a common name.
The common name can be anything you want, for example a helpful descriptive name like "ios-mybiz".
Check *Saved to disk* and *Let me specify key pair information*, then click *Continue*.

Give your CSR a helpful descriptive name, such as *iosapp.certSigningRequest*, and choose the location to save it on your hard drive, then click *Save*.

The next screen, *About Creating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)* has information about creating a CSR in Keychain Access.
You already did this, so go to the next screen. "Add iOS Certificate", to upload the CSR you already created, then click the *Generate* button.

Your new certificate is named *ios_distribution.cer*.
