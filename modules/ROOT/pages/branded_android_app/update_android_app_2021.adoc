= Update to Android App Bundle (starting August 2021)
:toc: right

== Introduction

Google Play will started requiring new apps to be published with the Android App Bundle in August 2021 footnote:[https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle]. The APK was replaced as the standard publishing format. ownBrander now generates 3 artifacts with every build:

* `*-release.aab`: Android App Bundle for Play Store distribution after August 2021
* `*-release.apk`: Needs signing, use for distribution methods other than Play Store
* `*-debug.apk`: Install directly on device for debugging purpose

For the Android App Bundles, Play App Signing is required footnote:[https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/the-future-of-android-app-bundles-is.html]. Play App Signing is a safety feature provided by Google. Every new release will automatically be signed by Google. (With this, Apps no longer need to be signed locally.)

Navigate to the Google Play Console Page and click on the Play Console Button.

https://play.google.com/console/about/

You will then land on the developer account sign-on page. https://play.google.com/console/developers.  After successful log-on, choose the appropriate developers account.

The page should appear like this. Choose the designated app, which is to be signed and/or updated.

Google Play Console will prompt you through this. Follow the steps to validate your app-Integrity.
Click the "activate" button.

Since this is a new release version candidate, and the key comes from the Java KeyStore, choose this option. 
Otherwise, choose according to your existing key scheme.

Follow the instructions pertaining to the chosen key scheme. (Here: JavaKeyStore)
Download the PEPK-Tool as instructed.

Open a terminal window and type the following command with your keystore parameters:

* KeyStore Alias
* Key Store Password
* Key Alias Password

Those are the parameters you used before, to sign the app. Maybe die waren auch im ownBrander drinâ€¦

As seen in the screen after the command, you can click on the copy icon in step 2 to copy the entire block, but you must modify the "foo" parts of the command as follows:

* `foo.keystore` must be replaced by the `keystore name` (here: damken)
* `Alias` is the `app name` (here: damkencloud) aka the `Key Alias`.

[source,java]
----
java -jar pepk.jar --keystore=foo.keystore --alias=foo --output=encrypted_private_key_path
----

After executing the above command, you will be prompted to enter both the passwords for "your keystore password" and then for "your key alias password".
Keep in mind, that these passwords are invisible when typing them. (Multiple entries or typos lead to errors.)

You can also check your signing parameters in ownBrander, if you have uploaded them for previous versions.

In case you execute the PEPK tool on macOS, you'll need additional permissions in the macOS "Security & Privacy" settings:
