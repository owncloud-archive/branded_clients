= Update to Android App Bundle (after August 2021)
:toc: right

== Introduction

Since August 2021, Google Play requires the Android App Bundle (.aab) for publishing new apps. footnote:[https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle]. With this change, the APK has been replaced as the standard publishing format. The ownBrander now generates 3 artifacts with every build:

* `*-release.aab`: Android App Bundle for Play Store distribution after August 2021
* `*-release.apk`: Needs signing. Use for distribution methods other than Play Store
* `*-debug.apk`: Install directly to your device for debugging purposes

For the Android App Bundles, Play App Signing is required footnote:[https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/06/the-future-of-android-app-bundles-is.html]. Play App Signing is a safety feature provided by Google. Every new release will automatically be signed by Google. (With this, apps no longer need to be signed locally.)

Navigate to the Google Play Console Page and click on the Play Console Button.

https://play.google.com/console/about/

You will then land on the developer account sign-on page. https://play.google.com/console/developers.  After successful log-on, choose the appropriate developers account.

The page should appear like this. Choose the designated app, which is to be signed and/or updated.

Google Play Console will guide you through this. Follow the steps to validate your app-Integrity.
Click the "activate" button.

Since this is a new release version candidate, and the key comes from the Java KeyStore, choose this option. 
Otherwise, choose according to your existing key scheme.

Follow the instructions pertaining to the chosen key scheme. (Here: JavaKeyStore)
Download the PEPK-Tool as instructed.

Gather your keystore parameters:

* KeyStore Alias
* Key Store Password
* Key Alias Password

These are the parameters you previously used to sign your app. Perhaps you kept them stored in the ownBrander.

Input the command below into an open terminal window. As seen in the screen after the command, you can click on the copy to clipboard icon (Step 2) to copy the entire command block, but you must modify the "foo" parts of the command as follows:

* `foo.keystore` must be replaced by the `keystore name` (here: damken)
* `Alias` is the `app name` (here: damkencloud) aka the `Key Alias`.


[source,java]
----
java -jar pepk.jar --keystore=foo.keystore --alias=foo --output=encrypted_private_key_path
----

After executing the above command, you will be prompted to enter both "your keystore password" and then "your key alias password".
Keep in mind that these passwords remain invisible while you type them. (Multiple entries or typos lead to errors.)

You can also check your signing parameters in ownBrander, if you have uploaded them for previous versions.

In case you downlaod the PEPK tool on macOS, you'll need additional permissions in the macOS "Security & Privacy" settings:
