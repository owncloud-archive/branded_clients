= Building Your App With ownBrander
:toc: right

== Introduction

Follow along and begin creating your ownBrander Android app. Within the ownBrander you will find that most of the fields that require your input are self-explanatory. If you still have questions, or perhaps suggestions, please feel free contact us.

After successfully logging into your account, navigate to the left side of your ownCloud instance and click on the inverted arrow to open the menu. Then click the ownBrander icon to open it.

Begin on the *Common Tab* and navigate to the *Required* area. 
Next, enter your application name and the URL of your ownCloud server in the corresponding fields.

These entries define your global defaults for all of the platforms in ownBrander. You can change them when you create your apps.

When you create production apps, you must then use your real app name, and the URL must point to your real ownCloud server.
(However, for testing purposes, these values can be anything.)

== Configuring ownBrander Parameters

Next, click on the *Android Tab*.
Here you will find another *Required* area to fill out. 
You will also see two additional tabs: *Optional*, and *Advanced*. These are not mandatory for the processing of your branding experience.

Start in the *Required* section and type in your application name, your Android package name and your account typ.

Move on to styling your app.

*Wizard for your Branding Images*

Building an Android app requires just a few images (preferably PNG format). The wizard also provides you with the exact dimension requirements. Please make certain that your images fulfill the specifications.

Now you can upload your images into the pre-defined boxes.

Proceed to the section regarding the signing of your Android client and click on the check-box if you want this option. Please, provide the required information for the three fields (Key Store Passord, Key Alias and Key Alias Password.) You will need these credentials in the Google Play Store Console. 

Upon completion for a first-time ownCloud branding or after performing any modifications (updating your app), click the *Generate Android App* button.

After the above mentioned time frame, open your account at: 
https://customer.owncloud.com/owncloud/[customer.owncloud.com]

The ownBrander produces three files required in order to produce your app. These are automatically uploaded into your personal folder. 

Choose the folder with your name name to find the folders for your various branded clients.

Choose the Mobile App for Android folder.
This folder should contain the three files seen in the image below. The .aab file is of relevance for your app in the Google Play Console.

Now you must sign your app in the Google Play Store in order to distribute it to your users.
