= Sphinx Bootstrap Theme

:toc:

This repository integrates the Twitter http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/[Bootstrap] CSS / JavaScript framework as a http://sphinx.pocoo.org/[Sphinx] http://sphinx.pocoo.org/theming.html[theme]. A live http://ryan-roemer.github.com/sphinx-bootstrap-theme[demo] is available to preview the theme.

== Installation

To install the theme, download the theme directory and update your configuration

1.  Create a ``_themes'' directory in your project source root.
2.  Get the ``bootstrap'' themes either as raw files or as a zipfile from the repository.
a.  Most current way is to just clone this repo or download the full repo source and move the ``bootstrap'' directory to ``_themes''.
b.  Alternatively, there are some prepackaged theme zip files (containing only the theme files), which can be read directly by Sphinx. See the repo https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/downloads[downloads] page for available packages. Then download ``bootstrap.zip'':
+
....
$ cd /path/to/_themes
$ wget https://github.com/downloads/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme/bootstrap.zip
....
+
In addition to the ``current'' release, the GitHub zipfiles have either git hash releases (for development builds) or tags for official tagged releases. E.g.:
+
....
bootstrap.zip
bootstrap-v0.0.2.zip
bootstrap-f51d73491e9bae68eb1b1c57059d9e0ece03d125.zip
....
3.  Edit your configuration file to point to the bootstrap theme:
+
....
# Activate the theme.
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('_themes'))
html_theme_path = ['_themes']
html_theme = 'bootstrap'

# (Optional) Use a shorter name to conserve nav. bar space.
html_short_title = "Demo"

# (Optional) Logo. Should be exactly 32x32 px to fit the nav. bar.
# Path should be relative to the html_static_path setting (e.g.,
# "_static") in source.
html_logo = "my_logo.png"
....

== Theme Notes

=== Sphinx

The theme places the global TOC, local TOC, navigation (prev, next) and source links all in the top Bootstrap navigation bar, along with the Sphinx search bar on the left side.

The global (site-wide) table of contents is the ``Site'' navigation dropdown, which is a multi-level deep rendering of the `toctree` for the entire site. The local (page-level) table of contents is the ``Page'' navigation dropdown, which is a multi-level rendering of the current pageâ€™s `toc`.

Generally speaking, this is a quick and dirty hack to get the basic theme going, so there are likely some oversights and lurking issues. Help and bug filings for the project are most welcome.

=== Bootstrap

The theme uses Twitter Bootstrap v2.0. You can override any static JS/CSS files by dropping different versions in your Sphinx ``_static'' directory.
